                <h3 style="color: #33ade3; border-bottom: 2px solid #33ade3">Human development</h3>
                <p>Human development is a process of enlarging people’s choices—as they acquire more capabilities and enjoy more opportunities to use those capabilities to enhance well-being. </p>
                <p>Human development implies that people are not only beneficiaries of development, but must influence the process that shapes their lives. </p>
                <p>In all this, economic growth is an important means to human development, but not the goal. And there is no automatic link between economic growth and human development.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-target="#path30">
                <h3 style="color: #f1b234; border-bottom: 2px solid #f1b234">Work</h3>
                <p>For this report, work is defined as any activity that not only leads to the production and consumption of goods or services, but also goes beyond production for economic valuejobs and employment, but also unpaid care work, voluntary work and creative expressions. Work thus includes activities that may result in broader human well-being, both for the present and for the future generations.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-target="#path22">
                <h3 style="color: #f1b234; border-bottom: 2px solid #f1b234">Human development is affected by work through many channels</h3>
                <p><strong>Income and livelihood.</strong> People work primarily to achieve a decent standard of living. In market-based economies they generally do so through wage or self-employment.</p>
                <p><strong>Security.</strong> Through work people can build a secure basis for their and their families’ lives, enabling them to make long-term decisions and establish priorities and choices.</p>
                <p><strong>Women’s empowerment.</strong> Women who earn income from work often achieve greater economic autonomy and decision-making power within families and communities.</p>
                <p><strong>Participation and voice.</strong> By interacting with others through work, people learn to participate in collective decision-making and gain a voice.</p>
                <p><strong>Dignity and recognition.</strong> Good work is recognized by co-workers, peers and others and provides a sense of accomplishment, self-respect and social identity.</p>
                <p><strong>Creativity and innovation.</strong> Work unleashes human creativity and has generated countless innovations that have revolutionized many aspects of human life—as in health, education, communications and environmental sustainability.</p>
            </div>
            <div data-target="#path26">
                <h3 style="color: #33ade3; border-bottom: 2px solid #33ade3;">Workers can also benefit from higher human development, again operating through multiple channels</h3>
                <p><strong>Health.</strong> Healthier workers have longer and more productive working lives and can explore more options at home and abroad.</p>
                <p><strong>Knowledge and skills.</strong> Better educated and trained workers can do more diverse work—and to a higher standard—and be more creative and innovative.</p>
                <p><strong>Awareness.</strong> Workers who can participate more fully in their communities will be able to negotiate at work for better conditions and higher labour standards, which in turn will make industries more efficient and competitive.</p>
