Need Support?

We've got your back!

You've got a couple of options available to you:

1. Simply head back to the marketplace where you purchased the theme, and leave a comment in the theme's comment section, and a swift response will be given accordingly.

2. Alternatively, send an email to help@themescollective.com and we'll get back to you the same day. Please add 'Theme Help' to the subject line, and be sure to give the name of the theme you are requesting help with.
